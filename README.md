Assuming you have Conda installed on your system, here are the instructions to create a new Conda environment named "capstone", activate it, and install the required packages:<br>

Open your terminal or Anaconda prompt.<br>
Type the following command to create a new Conda environment named "capstone":<br>
```conda create --name capstone```

Once the environment is created, activate it by typing:<br>
```conda activate capstone```

Install the required packages by typing:<br>
```conda install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter```

This will install the Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Jupyter packages in your "capstone" environment.
Finally, copy the "InD_dataset" folder from your Documents directory to your current working directory
